# In Perl v5.35 or lower, we could use the following one-liner
# to dump the content of file.

$ perl -e 'while (<>) { print $_ }' < sample.txt

# In Perl v5.36, a new command line option -g added which enables
# slurp mode. The above one-liner can now be re-written as below:

$ p536 -ge '$r = <>; print $r' < sample.txt
